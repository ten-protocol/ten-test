# Sample Hardhat Project

Created as described at https://hardhat.org/tutorial/creating-a-new-hardhat-project i.e. 

```shell
npm init
npm install --save-dev hardhat
npx hardhat init
```

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a 
script that deploys that contract. Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
