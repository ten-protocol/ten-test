class MerkleTreeHelper:
    """Helper used for value transfers from the L2 to the L1.

    When funds are transferred out of the L2 to the L1, the block containing the transaction has a crossChainTree field
    in the header, which contains a list of tuples, where each tuple has the hash of the value transfer event (v), and a
    hash of the cross chain message (m) received by the L1, e.g.

      [['v', '0xef10cef846b3934ebd733cf8d3fb330d3b2b4810621279cc5242a2b840570162'],
      ['m', '0xc5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470']]

    All values in the tuples are used to create a merkle tree, where the root is also contained in the block header
    as the crossChainTreeHash field. For TEN users that perform a sendNative to transfer funds out of the L2, the block
    is accessible, as is the crossChainTree and crossChainTreeHash. This means they are able to take the hash of their
    value transfer, and the merkle tree root, and construct a proof that their value transfer is in that tree. They
    can use that proof on the L1 management contract for it to release their funds back to their L1 account.
