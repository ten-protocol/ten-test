        <title>Bridge: ethers withdraw native funds across the bridge using sendNative and ExtractNativeValue</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
Hands over the transaction and processing of the send native call, and value transfer extraction, from python to
an ethers client. The client sends two transactions in quick order to get a xchain tree with multiple leafs, and
therefore a proof that is non null. One of the transactions is released and the test ensures the balance of the sender
goes up as expected (including the costs on the L1 side).
