        <title>Callbacks: two phase commit where the callback triggers a revert</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
Deploys the error contract which implements the two phase commit approach. Transacting with the contract results in a
callback to a method which has a revert that triggers - we expect this to be handled in the same way in which it
would had it been done without the call back approach.

Skipped due to https://github.com/ten-protocol/ten-internal/issues/4282
