        <title>Account going through separate connection can't get receipt but can get logs (lifecycle)</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
Through one connection account 1 deploys the storage contract and transacts. Through the same connection (so same token)
account 2 requests the transaction receipt and decodes the event log (this should work). Through a separate connection
(so different token) account 3 tries to request the transaction receipt but this fails as the transaction receipt is
encrypted. Instead, it performs a getLogs request on the contract Stored event from the block number the event log was
added into, and then can finally see the logs.
