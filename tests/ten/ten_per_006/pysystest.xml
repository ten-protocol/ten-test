        <title>Latency - key storage, event log receipt time</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
The test uses N web3.js clients to submit a transaction to set a key value pair in the KeyStorage contract, and set up
an event subscriber which filters on that key pair. Once the event triggers the subscriber, the process is repeated
using the same key but a monoticially increased value. The client signs the transaction locally and measured the time
between sending the signed transaction to the network, and the receipt of the event log. Multiple clients are run
concurrently using unique keys, and the overall latency profile is produced by binning the latency into increments
and plotting as a distribution.
