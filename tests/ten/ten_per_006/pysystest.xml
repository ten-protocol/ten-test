        <title>TPS: rates for funds transfer, using increasing clients within the test run</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
This test continues on from ten_per_004 where a number of concurrent clients are performing funds transfer from one
sending account to 8 receiving accounts. The difference is we scale up the number of receiving accounts to try and
see if there is a levelling of the TPS indicating the maximum throughput possible in the network. We also plot out the
binned throughput for two runs with varying number of concurrent clients to see if the temporal binned throughput starts
to show time gaps where no blocks are being created.
