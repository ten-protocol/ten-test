        <title>Gateway - single gateway with two token connections and two accounts registered (subscribe contract)</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
Tests transacting and subscribing for event logs with two connections (so different tokens), each with two accounts
registered. For each connection a single event log subscription is made for all events from a given contract, i.e.

 - Two connections created through the join operation (id_1 and id_2 say, different tokens)
 - Each connection has two registered accounts (account_1 and account_2 for id_1, account_3 and account_4 for id_2)
 - A contract is deployed which emits an event of the form event Stored(uint256 value) on a specific transaction,
   so it has no indexed fields for the relevancy rules and should therefore be treated as a lifecycle event
 - One subscription is made against each of the connections for all events from the contract (so there is nothing in the
   filter condition to identify which account to be used in the subscription with the network)
 - Each user initiates a transaction to result in a Stored event to be emitted (so a total of 4 events will be emitted)
