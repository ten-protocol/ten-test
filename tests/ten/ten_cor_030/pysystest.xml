        <title>Gateway - single wallet with two user_id connections and two accounts registered (subscribe contract)</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[Tests transacting and subscribing for event logs with two user_ids, each with two accounts
registered. For each user_id a single event log subscription is made for all events from a given contract.

 - One wallet extension
 - Two users ids created through the join operation (id_1 and id_2 say)
 - Each user id has two registered accounts (account_1 and account_2 against id_1, account_3 and account_4 against id_2)
 - A contract is deployed which emits an event of the form event Stored(uint256 value) on a specific transaction,
   so it has no indexed fields for the relevancy rules and would therefore be treated as a lifecycle event
 - One subscription is made against each of the user ids for all events from the contract (so there is nothing in the
   filter condition to identify which account to be used in the subscription with the network)
 - Each user initiates a transaction to result in a Stored event to be emitted (so a total of 4 events will be emitted)
