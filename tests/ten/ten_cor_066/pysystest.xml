        <title>Visibility Config: get logs, public event, one event is public</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
Use a simple guessing game, with VisibilityConfig.eventLogConfigs[0].isPublic set to true. This is set for one event
within the contract, the Guessed event, such that anyone is able to receive call backs for it. In this test two gateways
are used, the first by a dev user that deploys the contract and the second by a player of the game. The dev user waits
for the player to play some moves, then runs a script to getPastEvents on the contract to see what the user was playing.
Normally without setting isPublic to true, the dev user would not be able to see the event.
