        <title>RPC: rates for handling balance requests, increasing clients</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
Spawns a set number of clients querying for their balance, and measures the throughput and latency in the response.
In the test, increasing number of concurrent clients are started (two through to twenty in each iteration) which
perform the requests and log the time in ns for the response. Once done the data is sorted and binned to measure the
average and mode latency, and the throughput during periods where all clients are executing concurrently. Note if
we have minimal overlap then this could be quite a narrow time window, so bulk throughput is also measured. We plot
the latency and throughput as a function of the number of concurrent clients, and the latency and throughput
distribution for the case of four concurrent clients.
