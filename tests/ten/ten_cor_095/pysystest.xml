        <title>Visibility Config: request debug_logVisibility, single lifecycle event, default contract</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
Makes a call to debug log visibility for a single lifecycle event defined by the storage contract. Reminder that
where there are no account addresses in an event's topics, then the event is considered relevant to everyone and termed
a life-cycle event. The storage contract has no visibility configuration set up and is therefore a default contract.

Note that the semantics of the return values are as below;
  defaultContract:     true when no config
  transparentContract: true when ContractCfg.TRANSPARENT
  eventConfigPublic:   true when Field.EVERYONE specified OR when ContractCfg.TRANSPARENT
  topic1Relevant:      true when Field.TOPIC1 specified
  topic2Relevant:      true when Field.TOPIC2 specified
  topic3Relevant:      true when Field.TOPIC3 specified
  senderRelevant:      true when Field.SENDER specified
  eventAutoVisibility: true if you haven't configured the event explicitly (but it is not a default contract)
  eventAutoPublic:     true if you haven't configured the event explicitly AND there were no EOA addresses in the topics
  topic1AutoRelevant:  true if you haven't configured the event explicitly AND topic1 contains an EOA
  topic2AutoRelevant:  true if you haven't configured the event explicitly AND topic2 contains an EOA
  topic3AutoRelevant:  true if you haven't configured the event explicitly AND topic3 contains an EOA

There are 3 possible states for the values;
  was explicitly set to true/false
  was not set and does not apply (so null)

Note that you cannot explicitly set a value to false, but certain values will be set to false when one of it's relevant
group is set to true i.e. Field.TOPIC1 set to true (included in the config) will set TOPIC2, TOPIC3 and SENDER all to
false, and therefore be reflected in the topic2Relevant, topic3Relevant and senderRelevant values as false also.
