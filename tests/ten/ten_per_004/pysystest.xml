        <title>TPS: funds transfer, four external concurrent clients (1 sending, 8 receiving accounts each)</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
The test uses four clients to perform the bulk loading of transactions into the network concurrently, as per
ten_per_002. We can again see if more clients (four vs two) allows us to increase the transaction processing rate.
Note that the test can be run with a higher number of clients using the -XCLIENTS=<num> CLI argument to the test, so the
distribution can be explored. Pauses in the times when transactions are mined means that blocks are not created
continuously e.g. the network takes longer to fill a block than one second. As well as plotting how the transactions are
included into blocks based on the block time, we plot how the transactions are included into blocks based on the block
number. This should be continuous and show how the transactions are distributed in terms of numbers into the blocks.
Plotting the individual binned transactions on a 3-D plot allows us to see that the clients are overlapping in the
processing of their transactions.
