        <title>Visibility Config: tx receipt, ContractCfg.PRIVATE, Field.TOPIC1 on one event</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
Uses a simple guessing game, with ContractCfg.PRIVATE and Field.TOPIC1 set for the Guessed event, such that if topic1
is an address, only that address can see it. Two gateway connections are used, the first by a dev user that deploys the
contract and the second by a player of the game. The dev user tries to get the tx receipt from the tx hash, but as they
cannot see any events (none are open to them) they should fail in the request.
