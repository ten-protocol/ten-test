        <title>TPS: funds transfer, two external concurrent clients (1 sending, 8 receiving accounts each)</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
The test uses two clients to perform the bulk loading of transactions into the network concurrently, as per
ten_per_001, though in this test we use 1 transfer account to 8 randomly chosen recipient accounts. The test looks to
see if the TPS can be increased using two clients feeding transactions at the same time, and also the trend of the
processing i.e. do we see synchronised pauses implying that the network is at issue.
