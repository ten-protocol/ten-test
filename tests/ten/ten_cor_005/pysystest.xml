        <title>Event relevancy: 4 accounts own gateway, 4 accounts subscribe, 1 life-cycle event, 4 received</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
We have 4 accounts registered and connected to the network through their own gateways. All accounts subscribe
to all events from the relevancy contract. Account4 transacts resulting in a NonIndexedAddressAndNumber event being
emitted. As this is a life-cycle event, and each account has subscribed for all events through their own gateway, all
subscriptions should receive the event.
