        <title>Visibility Config - contract calls another, both emit an event with address, both contain same EOA</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
Checks that transacting against a contract, whose function calls into another contract, and both functions emit an
event, works correctly. The contract call goes EventEmitterCaller.callEmitAddressEvent -> EventEmitter.emitAddressEvent.
In this case msg.sender in EventEmitterCaller.callEmitAddressEvent is the account that performs the transaction, as is
the address passed to the EventEmitter.emitAddressEvent. The events are defined as;

  AddressEvent(uint indexed id, address indexed _address);
  CallerAddressEvent(uint indexed id, address indexed _address);

Note that we expect AddressEvent to be emitted first, and then CallerAddressEvent to be emitted next. The AddressEvent
address is an EOA address. Hence the account calling EventEmitterCaller.callEmitAddressEvent should see both events,
whereas another account should not see any events, or indeed should not be able to get the transaction receipt.
