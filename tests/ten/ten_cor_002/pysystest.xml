        <title>Event relevancy - 4 accounts own gateway, 4 accounts subscribe, 1 relevant event, 1 received</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
We have 4 accounts registered and connected to the network through their own gateways. Account4 is connected through the
primary gateway, and deploys the relevancy contract; all accounts then subscribe to all events from the contract.
Account4 transacts against the contract to produce a CallerIndexedAddress event that contains their calling address.
As such, only Account4's subscription should receive back an event i.e. the other accounts should receive nothing.
