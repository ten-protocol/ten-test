        <title>Event relevancy - 4 accounts own WE, 4 accounts subscribe, 1 relevant event, 1 received</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
We have 4 accounts registered and connected to the network through their own wallet extensions. Account4 deploys the
relevancy contract and all accounts subscribe to all events from the contract. Account 4 transacts against the contract
to produce a CallerIndexedAddress event that contains their calling address. As such, only Account4's subscription should
receive back an event i.e. the other accounts should receive nothing.
