        <title>Gateway: two registered users with a single subscription (subscribe all logs)</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
In the test we have a user that deploys and transacts against the Storage contract through the primary gateway and
it's own connection. Another connection is created with two registered users, and a single subscription is made to all
event logs from the network. Since the Storage Store event is a lifecycle event, and we subscribe to all event logs from
the network, we expect a single call back for our subscriber (de-duplication).
