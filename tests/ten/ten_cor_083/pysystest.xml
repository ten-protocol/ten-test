        <title>Visibility Config: tx receipt, ContractCfg.PRIVATE, Field.TOPIC2 on one event</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
Uses a simple guessing game, with ContractCfg.PRIVATE and Field.TOPIC2 set for the Guessed event, such that if topic2
is an address, only that address can see it. Two gateway connections are used, the first by a dev user that deploys the
contract and the second by a player of the game. Topic2 is not an address so doesn't have an effect, however as Topic1
is not set the user will not be able to see the Guessed event, but will be able to see the Attempts event; the dev
user will be able to see neither.
