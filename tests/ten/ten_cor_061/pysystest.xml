        <title>Visibility Config: subscribe, ContractCfg.TRANSPARENT, check events</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
Use a simple guessing game, with ContractCfg.TRANSPARENT. This opens up calls to get_storage_at, and additionally makes
all events public. Two gateway connections are used, the first by a dev user that deploys the contract and the second
by a player of the game. The dev user has a subscriber to the events, and should be able to see the events even though
they contain an EOA which does not belong to them (so both Guessed and Attempts).
