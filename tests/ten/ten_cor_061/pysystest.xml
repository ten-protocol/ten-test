        <title>Visibility Config: transparent contract, all events are public with a guessing game</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
Use a simple guessing game, with VisibilityConfig.isTransparent set to true. This opens up calls to get_storage_at, and
additionally makes all events public. In this test two gateways are used, the first by a dev user that deploys the
contract and the second by a player of the game. The dev user has a subscriber to the events, and should be able to
see the events even though they contain an EOA which does not belong to them.
