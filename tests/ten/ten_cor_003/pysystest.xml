        <title>Event relevancy: 4 accounts single gateway and token, 1 account subscribes, 4 unique relevant events</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
We have 4 accounts registered and connected to the network through a single gateway user_id. Account4 deploys the
relevancy contract and subscribes to all events from the contract. As the subscription to all events gives no indication
of the originator of the subscription, the gateway subscribes to all events for each of the accounts registered (there
are thus 4 subscriptions). Each account transacts against the contract to produce a CallerIndexedAddress event that
contains their calling address. As such, each subscription should receive back the event log relevant to them i.e.
there should be 4 events logged.
