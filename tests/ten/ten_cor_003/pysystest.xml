        <title>Event relevancy - 4 accounts single WE, 1 account subscribes, 4 unique relevant events, 4 received</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
We have 4 accounts registered and connected to the network through a single wallet extension. Account4 deploys the
relevancy contract and subscribes to all events from the contract. As the subscription to all events gives no
indication of the originator of the subscription, the wallet extension subscribes to all events for each of the accounts
registered (there are thus 4 subscriptions). Each account transacts against the contract to produce a CallerIndexedAddress
event that contains their calling address. As such, each subscription should receive back the event log relevant to them
i.e. there should be 4 events logged.
