        <title>Bridge: withdraw native funds across the bridge using sendNative and ExtractNativeValue</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
Uses a non-ephemeral account to send ETH from the L2 to the L1. This is initiated by a sendNative call to the
Ethereum Bridge, for which the transaction receipt is used to get the block number on the L2 so that the xchain
merkle tree leafs can be decoded. The message itself is obtained from the value transfer event log on the transaction
receipt. Using the message hash of the message, and the message type, the root and proof can be obtained from the
node by repeated calls to an RPC method. Note the test also calculates this independently using the full xchain tree.
The message hash, proof and root are then used to release the funds on the L1 via a call to ExtractNativeValue to the
management contract.
