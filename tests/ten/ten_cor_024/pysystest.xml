        <title>Bridge - withdraw native funds across the bridge using sendNative and ExtractNativeValue</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
Uses a non-ephemeral account to send ETH from the L2 to the L1. This is initiated by a sendNative call to the
Ethereum Bridge, for which the transaction receipt is used to get the block number on the L2 so that the
xchain merkle tree leafs can be decoded. From this the client can construct their own merkle tree to get the root
hash and compare with the root hash also included in the block header to validate the correctness of their tree. The
leaf of the transfer value event can then be created and should match one of the leaf entries. From the leaf hash and the
merkle tree the proof of inclusion can be constructed. The leaf hash, proof and root are then used to release the
funds on the L1 via a call to ExtractNativeValue to the management contract. Note that funds cannot be released on the L1
until the xchain tree is seen ... to do this keep checking the gas to perform the release until it doesn't revert. On
a local testnet this can take 180 seconds, on a real deployment it can take 30 mins.
