        <title>Visibility Config: subscribe, ContractCfg.PRIVATE, Field.EVERYONE on one event</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
Uses a simple guessing game, with ContractCfg.PRIVATE and Field.EVERYONE set for the Guessed event, such that anyone is
able to see it. Two gateway connections are used, the first by a dev user that deploys the contract and the second by a
player of the game. The dev user has a subscriber to the event, and should be able to see the event logs even though
they contain an EOA which does not belong to them. They should not be able to see the Attempts event as that remains
private as there is no overriding config.
