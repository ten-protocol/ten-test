        <title>Visibility Config: subscribe, public event, one event is public</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
Use a simple guessing game, with VisibilityConfig.eventLogConfigs[0].isPublic set to true. This is set for one event
within the contract, the Guessed event, such that anyone is able to receive call backs for it. In this test two gateways
are used, the first by a dev user that deploys the contract and the second by a player of the game. The dev user has a
subscriber to the events, and should be able to see the events even though they contain an EOA which does not belong
to them.
