        <title>Callbacks: privacy callback where the callback triggers a require</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
Deploys the error contract which implements the two phase commit approach. Transacting with the contract results in a
callback to a method which has a require that triggers. The transaction to register the callback will be successful,
i.e. there is no indication to the user that the callback will fail. It is the developer of the contract's responsibility
to emit events to indicate if the call was successful under these situations.
