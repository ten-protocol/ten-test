        <title>Visibility Config - request debug_logVisibility, single non-lifecycle event, default contract</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
Makes a call to debug log visibility for a single non-lifecycle event defined by the relevancy contract. Reminder
that where there are no account addresses in an event's topics, then the event is considered relevant to everyone and
is termed a life-cycle event. In this case an address is included in the event. The relevancy contract has no visibility
configuration set up and is therefore a default contract.
