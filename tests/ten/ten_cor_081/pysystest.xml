        <title>Visibility Config - tx receipt, ContractCfg.PRIVATE, Field.EVERYONE on one event</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
Uses a simple guessing game, with ContractCfg.PRIVATE and Field.EVERYONE set for the Guessed event, such that anyone is
able to see it. Two gateway connections are used, the first by a dev user that deploys the contract and the second by a
player of the game. The dev user gets the transaction from an attempt by the player, and should be able to see the
Guessed event, but not the Attempts event.
