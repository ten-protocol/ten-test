        <title>Visibility Config: get logs, transparent contract, all events are public</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
Uses a simple guessing game, with VisibilityConfig.isTransparent set to true. This opens up calls to get_storage_at, and
additionally makes all events public. Two gateway connections are used, the first by a dev user that deploys the
contract and the second by a player of the game. The dev user waits for the player to play some moves, then runs
a script to getPastEvents on the contract to see what the user was playing. Normally without setting isTransparent to
true, the dev user would not be able to see the events.
