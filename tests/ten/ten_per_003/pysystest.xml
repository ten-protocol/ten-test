        <title>TPS: funds transfer, two external concurrent clients (20 sending, 8 receiving accounts each)</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
The test uses two clients to perform the bulk loading of transactions into the network concurrently, as per
ten_per_002, though in this test we use 20 transfer account to 8 randomly chosen recipient accounts. The test looks to
see if there is any decrease in TPS if we use a higher number of sending accounts. Once completed the client also
iterates through all the mined transactions and requests the transaction receipt, logging the time it takes to receive
after requesting. The data is additionally binned for plotting to see the distribution in wait times.
