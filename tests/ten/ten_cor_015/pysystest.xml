        <title>Event relevancy - non-lifecycle event with an unseen account address</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
This replicates an issue that was seen in sepolia-testnet where the steps to reproduce were;

- a new contract is created that has a private event on it
- the first time that event is emitted it can only involve an account that we've never seen before
- then later when the contract emits the event but for an address that the network has seen before, it will realise
  it's a private event and hit this error

The unseen address seems to need a particular format and can be re-created as per the statically coded address used in
the test. Note also, in the current implementation an event is not relevant to the originator of the transaction that
created it unless their address is included in the event.
