        <title>Visibility Config: subscribe, public event, one EOA in event can view</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
Uses a simple guessing game, with VisibilityConfig.eventLogConfigs[0].isPublic set to false, and topic1CanView set to
true. This is set for one event within the contract, the Guessed event. Two gateway connections are used, the first
by a dev user that deploys the contract and the second by a player of the game. The dev user has a subscriber to the
events, and should be able to see the events given the EOA of the Guessed event is topic1 and has been made public.
