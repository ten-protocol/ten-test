        <title>Visibility Config: from tx receipt, public event, one event is public</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
Uses a simple guessing game, with VisibilityConfig.eventLogConfigs[0].isPublic set to true. This is set for one event
within the contract, the Guessed event, such that anyone is able to see it. Two gateway connections are used, the first
by a dev user that deploys the contract and the second by a player of the game. The player makes a guess, and using the
tx hash the dev user gets the transaction receipt and attempts to parse out the event log. Given the event is public we
expect the dev user to be able to get the event logs from the tx receipt, even though they did not initiate the
transaction.
