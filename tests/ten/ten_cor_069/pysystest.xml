        <purpose><![CDATA[
Uses a simple guessing game, with VisibilityConfig.eventLogConfigs[0].isPublic set to true. This is set for one event
within the contract, the Guessed event, such that anyone is able to see it. Two gateway connections are used, the first
by a dev user that deploys the contract and the second by a player of the game.
