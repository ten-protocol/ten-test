        <title>Event relevancy - 4 accounts own WE, 4 accounts subscribe, 1 relevant event two addresses, 2 received</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
We have 4 accounts registered and connected to the network through their own wallet extensions. All accounts subscribe
to all events from the relevancy contract. Account4 transacts resulting in a TwoIndexedAddresses event being emitted
containing address fields for Account4, and Account1. As such Account4 and Account1 should see the event log returned in
their subscriptions as the event is relevant to them, whereas Account2 and Account3 should not.
