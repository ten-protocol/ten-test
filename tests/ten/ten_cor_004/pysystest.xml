        <title>Event relevancy: 4 accounts own gateway, 4 accounts subscribe, 1 relevant event two addresses, 2 received</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
We have 4 accounts registered and connected to the network through their own gateways. All accounts subscribe to all
events from the relevancy contract. Account4 transacts resulting in a TwoIndexedAddresses event being emitted containing
address fields for Account4, and Account1. As such Account4 and Account1 should see the event log returned in their
subscriptions as the event is relevant to them, whereas Account2 and Account3 should not.
