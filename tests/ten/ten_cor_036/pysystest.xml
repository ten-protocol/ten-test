        <title>Tenscan RPC: call to get personal transactions (event is public)</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
A non-ephemeral account first performs five transactions against a contract that emits a public event. An ephemeral account
then queries to get their personal transactions, where they themselves have not submitted any. This is performed for both
cases where they request for just their personal transactions, and their personal and public transactions. It is assumed
that for the latter they will see the transactions made against the transparent contract, but for the former they will
not.
