        <title>Visibility Config - contract calls another, both emit an event with address, both contain different EOA</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
Checks that transacting against a contract, whose function calls into another contract, and both functions emit an
event, works correctly. The contract call goes EventEmitterCaller.callEmitAddressEvent -> EventEmitter.emitAddressEvent.
In this case msg.sender in EventEmitterCaller.callEmitAddressEvent is the account that performs the transaction, and
the address passed to the EventEmitter.emitAddressEvent is that of a different account. The events are defined as;

  AddressEvent(uint indexed id, address indexed _address);
  CallerAddressEvent(uint indexed id, address indexed _address);

Note that we expect AddressEvent to be emitted first, and then CallerAddressEvent to be emitted next. The AddressEvent
address is an EOA address. The account calling EventEmitterCaller.callEmitAddressEvent should see the CallerAddressEvent
event but not the AddressEvent, whereas the other account should not see the CallerAddressEvent event but should see the
AddressEvent.
