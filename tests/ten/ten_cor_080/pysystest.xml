        <title>Visibility Config: from tx receipt, transparent contract, all events are public</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
Uses a simple guessing game, with VisibilityConfig.isTransparent set to true. This opens up calls to get_storage_at, and
additionally makes all events public. Two gateway connections are used, the first by a dev user that deploys the
contract and the second by a player of the game. The player makes a guess, and using the tx hash the dev user gets the
transaction receipt and attempts to parse out the event log. Given the contract is transparent we expect the dev user to
be able to get the event logs from the tx receipt, even though they did not initiate the transaction.
