        <title>Visibility Config: tx receipt, ContractCfg.TRANSPARENT, check events</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
Uses a simple guessing game, with ContractCfg.TRANSPARENT. This opens up calls to get_storage_at, and additionally
makes all events public. Two gateway connections are used, the first by a dev user that deploys the contract and the
second by a player of the game. The second player makes a guess, and using the tx receipt hash the dev tries to get the
receipt and inspect the event logs to see what the player guessed (naughty naughty).

Skipped as this functionality is still be decided upon.
