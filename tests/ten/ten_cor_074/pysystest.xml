        <title>Visibility Config: get logs, ContractCfg.PRIVATE, include Field.SENDER on one event</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
Three players are used. The third player deploys the relevancy contract with ContractCfg.PRIVATE and Field.Sender
configured on the TwoIndexedAddresses event (Field.TOPIC1 and Field.TOPIC2 are also included). The third player calls
twoIndexedAddresses supplying the first and second player addresses. The first and second players getPastEvents and
should see the event as it is relevant to them both. The third player does the same and should also see it as
Field.SENDER is enabled.
