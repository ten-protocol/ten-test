        <title>Visibility Config: get logs, ContractCfg.PRIVATE, Field.TOPIC1 TOPIC2 SENDER on one event</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
Three accounts are used. The third account deploys the relevancy contract with ContractCfg.PRIVATE and Field.Sender
configured on the TwoIndexedAddresses event (Field.TOPIC1 and Field.TOPIC2 are also included). The third account calls
twoIndexedAddresses supplying the first and second account addresses. The first and second accounts getPastEvents and
should see the event as it is relevant to them both. The third account does the same and should also see it as
Field.SENDER is enabled.
