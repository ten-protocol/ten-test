        <title>TPS: transaction timing with attached subscribers</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
In this test we investigate if the number of attached subscribers to the network slows down the transaction processing
rate. For a given number of subscribers, a similar number of transactors are started serially sending in 250 transactions
each against the emitter contract - the transactions include transactions that emit events with arrays, structs,
mappings and primitives. There is a one-to-one mapping of transactors to subscribers, as each event emitted from the
transaction of a transactor includes an id, which the subscriber filters on. Thus during the serial running, subscribers
not tied into the currently executing transactor should be filtering out those events. The overall bulk through of any
run for a given number of subscribers is the total time to send all transactions over the time it took to send those
transactions. We expect to see constant bulk throughput with varying subscribers.
