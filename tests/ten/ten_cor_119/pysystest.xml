        <title>Callbacks: privacy callback on the storage contract with a refund</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
Uses a storage contract which supports refunds of gas. When a contract is called that is to be handled in a callback,
the callback id is mapped to the account making the transaction. When the callback is executed, a handleRefund is also
invoked to add residual funds to the contract that from the callback id can be mapped to the account and stored locally.
These funds can then be returned to the account on request.
