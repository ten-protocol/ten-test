        <title>Event relevancy - 4 accounts single gateway single token, 1 account subscribes, 1 lifecycle events</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
We have 4 accounts registered and connected to the network through a single gateways. Account4 deploys the relevancy
contract and subscribes to all events from the contract. As the subscription to all events gives no indication of the
originator of the subscription, the wallet extension subscribes to all events for each of the accounts registered (there
are thus 4 subscriptions). Account4 transacts against the contract to produce a single NonIndexedAddressAndNumber. This
should fire against all 4 subscriptions, but only one event should be returned to the subscriber as the events should be
de-duplicated.
