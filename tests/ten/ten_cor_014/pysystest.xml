        <title>Tenscan RPC: eth_getStorageAt for personal transactions (contract calls, transfers)</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
An ephemeral client joins the network and performs three transactions against two contracts deployed by a different
user. Another client joins the network and send funds to the first. The first client calls to get their personal
transactions and the test confirms receipt of all the txs they made, and all the txs they received (which would include
the tx to fund them initially). Note of the two contracts interacted with, neither use the privacy call back, one emits
a public event, and one emits no events.
