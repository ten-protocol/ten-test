        <title>Error: nonce too low</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
From my understanding the following should be the behaviour of nonces;

- Transactions with too low a nonce get immediately rejected.
- Transactions with too high a nonce get placed in the transaction pool queue.
- If transactions with nonces that fill the gap between the last valid nonce and
  the too high nonce are sent and the nonce sequence is complete, all the transactions in the sequence
  will get processed and mined.

This tests at the moment only checks when a tx is submitted with a nonce that is too low. It is currently not run on
TEN due to https://github.com/ten-protocol/ten-internal/issues/2786.
