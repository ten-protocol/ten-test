        <title>Payable: send native funds to a contract address</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
Deploys the ReceiveEth contract and transfers funds to it by constructing a tx using the to and value field to denote
the contract address, and the amount of funds to transfer. Note that on Obscuro, no pk is used to register with the
wallet extension for the event log subscription. The wallet extension has a viewing key already registered by account 1
used for deploying and interacting with the contract. As the wallet extension has a single registered viewing key,
this will be used for all relevancy checks when the subscription is made to the enclave.
