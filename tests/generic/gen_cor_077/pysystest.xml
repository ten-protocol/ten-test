        <title>Events: web3js client using contract.events.Event</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[]]>
This is the second of three ways to get event logs for a contract event that is emitted. It is a subscription
approach where the events.Event constructor on the contract instance is used, passing the filter options and supplying
a callback function to process the result and any potential errors. The storage contract is used which emits a single
event with an integer value (no addresses) and so should be visible to any interested parties within Obscuro. As a
subscription it uses websockets for the connection protocol (note we do not implement the same in python due to the
poor support for websockets in the web3.py library).
