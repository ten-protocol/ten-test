        <title>Events - one contract calls another and both emit an event (two addresses)</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
Checks that transacting against a contract, whose function calls into another contract, and both functions emit an
event, works correctly. Specifically, that the transaction receipt logs shows both events, and that they can be extracted
correctly from the receipt. In this case the caller supplies two addresses.

Note this is not enabled for TEN currently, as the behaviour is under debate on whether visibility rules should be
applied to event logs in transaction receipts. At the moment, only the originator of the transaction can actually
receive the transaction receipt.
