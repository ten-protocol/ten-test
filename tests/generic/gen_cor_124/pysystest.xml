        <title>Hardhat: deploy then transfer ownership and upgrade through transparent proxy</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
Executes a hardhat script to deploy an upgradeable contract via a transaprent proxy, and then transfer ownership of that
proxy to another user. A second hardhat script is then used to upgrade the constract to a new version by the new
owner. Note that the use of @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable is to allow the storage contract to be initialised with
a first value (you can not set directly with proxies).
