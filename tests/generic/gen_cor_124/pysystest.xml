        <title>Hardhat: deploy then transfer ownership and upgrade through transparent proxy</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
The test continues to use the transparent proxy model, but in this case after deployment it transfers the ownership of
the proxy admin to a new user. The contract is declared to be Initializable and OwnableUpgradeable so that firstly
an initialisation in the contract can be made (constructors not used for proxies), and secondly that it can have its
ownership transferred. Once ownership is transferred the contract is updated using the new owner (an operation that
would fail without the transfer).
