        <title>Hardhat: deploy an upgradable contract through a beacon proxy</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
In the Beacon pattern, a single Beacon Proxy holds details of the implementation contract and can then be referenced
by multiple proxies that all share the same implementation (done in some cases where we want different users to use
an independent proxy, but for it to be all managed by one implementation contract). The Beacon Proxy signals to the
proxies where the implementation lives (hence the name Beacon). With Beacon Proxies the interface for their deployment
and upgrade differs from Transparent and UUPS proxies.

In the test a single hardhat script deploys version 1 of a contract, then deploys the beacon proxy and the proxy. At
this point in time no upgrade is performed, and the test only ensure the initial version of the contract can be deployed
and that it is possible to interact with it.
