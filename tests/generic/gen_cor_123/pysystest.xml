        <title>Hardhat: deploy and upgrade a contract with state through a transparent proxy</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
The test continues to use the transparent proxy model, but in this case the contract that is upgraded has state that
should be persisted across the upgrade, and rather than add a new method to the contract, it overrides an existing one.
The deployment and upgrade are performed in two separate actions via independent hardhat scripts.
