        <title>Gas: send value with funds only covering the gas cost</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
This currently tests incorrect behaviour in ten, in that if an account is given funds just equal to the gas cost,
and then it tries to transfer value to another account, the tx will not be immediately rejected. Instead, the tx
will be accepted and will sit in the mempool. If the funds in the sending account are increased, we do not expect
the tx to be automatically retried and successful. Rather we expect to have to resend the tx on the same nonce for
it to then be picked up. This is the same behaviour as on ganache. However, we expect in the future the tx to be
rejected, as is currently the case on Sepolia and Arbitrum.
