        <title>Account going through separate connection can't get receipt but can get logs (lifecycle)</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[Through one wallet connection account 1 deploys the storage contract and transacts. Through
the same wallet connection account 2 requests the transaction receipt and decodes the event log (this should work).
Through a separate wallet connection account 3 tries to request the transaction receipt but this fails as the
transaction receipt is encrypted. Instead, it performs a getLogs request on the contract Stored event from the block
number the event log was added into, and then can finally see the logs.
