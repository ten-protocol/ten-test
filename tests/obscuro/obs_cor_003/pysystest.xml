        <title>Event relevancy - four subscriptions through single WE, event is relevant to account registered last</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
The game user account deploys the Relevancy contract, calls the method on the contract to emit the CallerIndexedAddress
with addr = the user account address. The following accounts are used to register (in this order) + the subscription
and event emission;

  Account 1 - shared wallet extension
  Account 2 - shared wallet extension
  Account 3 - shared wallet extension
  Game User - shared wallet extension

  Subscribe for the CallerIndexedAddress event which contains a single indexed address field (all)
  Event is emitted containing address of user account

Under this sequence currently the event is not decrypted and sent back to the subscription id, as it by default binds
to the first registered key.
