        <title>Event relevancy - four subscriptions through single WE, event is relevant to account registered first</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
Account4 deploys the Relevancy contract, calls the method on the contract to emit the CallerIndexedAddress
with addr = the user account address. The following accounts are used to register (in this order) + the subscription
and event emission;

  Account 4 - shared wallet extension
  Account 1 - shared wallet extension
  Account 2 - shared wallet extension
  Account 3 - shared wallet extension

  Subscribe for the CallerIndexedAddress event which contains a single indexed address field (all)
  Event is emitted containing address of user account4, account3, account2, account1.

Under this sequence only the event emitted for account4 should be received, as all subscriptions are performed with the
first registered accounts viewing key.
