        <title>Stress - multiple concurrent subscribers, additional subscribing and unsubscribing</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
A configurable number of subscribers are started to receive events from Obscuro, which stay subscribed for the duration
of the test. Another configurable number of a bespoke client is started, where they continually subscribe and then
unsubscribe repeatedly. Once running a set number of transactions are start and which are expected to be received by
the continual subscribers i.e. the concurrent subscribes and unsubscribes should not cause any issues.
