        <title>Stress - multiple concurrent subscribers, additional clients subscribing and unsubscribing</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
A configurable number of subscribers are started to receive events from Obscuro, which stay subscribed for the duration
of the test. Another configurable number of subscribers are started, where they continually subscribe and then
unsubscribe once call back on successful subscription is confirmed. Once running a set number of transactions are
performed where they are expected to be received by the permanent subscribers i.e. the concurrent subscribes and
unsubscribes should not cause any disruption to event notification / call back.
