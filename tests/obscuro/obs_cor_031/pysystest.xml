        <title>Gateway - two registered users with a single subscription (subscribe all logs)
        </title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[In the test we have a user that deploys and transacts against the Storage contract through
the primary wallet extension. A shared wallet extension is created with two registered users, and a single subscription
is made to all event logs from the network. Since the Storage Store event is a lifecycle event, and we subscribe to all
event logs from the network, we expect a single call back for our subscriber (de-duplication).
