        <title>TPS - bulk loading the mempool, once complete extract the block times for the TPS profile</title>
        <purpose><![CDATA[
In this test, a bulk amount of native OBC transfer transactions are created and signed (1 transfer account, to 25
recipient accounts). Each transaction has a monotonically increasing nonce. Once created all transactions are sent
to the node, and the transaction hash stored. The test waits for the last transaction none to be mined/included in a
batch, and once done fetches the block/batch each transaction was included into. From this it is possible to then
extract the timestamp of the block and graph the number of transactions as a function of time, offset from the first
batch. This thus gives a temporal profile of the TPS, and an overall rate based on the total time to send and mine
all transactions.
